      	The Hermitage fully lives up to its sterling reputation. You can be absorbed by its treasures for days and still come out wanting more. The enormous collection (over three million items, only a fraction of which are on display in 360 rooms) almost amounts to a comprehensive history of Western European art. Viewing it demands a little planning, so choose the areas you’d like to concentrate on before you arrive.

Since then it has served as the Empire’s capital, housed the royal family, witnessed three revolutions and survived an 870-day siege in World War II. Quite literally every building has played a role in history – here are some of the most significant.
